<h5 class="subsubsection">9.27.9.2 Supported FP ABIs</h5>

<p>The supported floating-point ABI variants are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>0 - No floating-point</code><dd>This variant is used to indicate that floating-point is not used within
the module at all and therefore has no impact on the ABI.  This is the
default.

     <br><dt><code>1 - Double-precision</code><dd>This variant indicates that double-precision support is used.  For 64-bit
ABIs this means that 64-bit wide floating-point registers are required. 
For 32-bit ABIs this means that 32-bit wide floating-point registers are
required and double-precision operations use pairs of registers.

     <br><dt><code>2 - Single-precision</code><dd>This variant indicates that single-precision support is used.  Double
precision operations will be supported via soft-float routines.

     <br><dt><code>3 - Soft-float</code><dd>This variant indicates that although floating-point support is used all
operations are emulated in software.  This means the ABI is modified to
pass all floating-point data in general-purpose registers.

     <br><dt><code>4 - Deprecated</code><dd>This variant existed as an initial attempt at supporting 64-bit wide
floating-point registers for O32 ABI on a MIPS32r2 CPU.  This has been
superseded by 5, 6 and 7.

     <br><dt><code>5 - Double-precision 32-bit CPU, 32-bit or 64-bit FPU</code><dd>This variant is used by 32-bit ABIs to indicate that the floating-point
code in the module has been designed to operate correctly with either
32-bit wide or 64-bit wide floating-point registers.  Double-precision
support is used.  Only O32 currently supports this variant and requires
a minimum architecture of MIPS II.

     <br><dt><code>6 - Double-precision 32-bit FPU, 64-bit FPU</code><dd>This variant is used by 32-bit ABIs to indicate that the floating-point
code in the module requires 64-bit wide floating-point registers. 
Double-precision support is used.  Only O32 currently supports this
variant and requires a minimum architecture of MIPS32r2.

     <br><dt><code>7 - Double-precision compat 32-bit FPU, 64-bit FPU</code><dd>This variant is used by 32-bit ABIs to indicate that the floating-point
code in the module requires 64-bit wide floating-point registers. 
Double-precision support is used.  This differs from the previous ABI
as it restricts use of odd-numbered single-precision registers.  Only
O32 currently supports this variant and requires a minimum architecture
of MIPS32r2.
