<h3 class="section">27.17 <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> Tracepoint Commands</h3>

<p>The commands defined in this section implement MI support for
tracepoints.  For detailed introduction, see <a href="Tracepoints.html#Tracepoints">Tracepoints</a>.

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-trace-find</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dtrace_002dfind-2947"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -trace-find <var>mode</var> [<var>parameters</var>...]
</pre>
   <p>Find a trace frame using criteria defined by <var>mode</var> and
<var>parameters</var>.  The following table lists permissible
modes and their parameters.  For details of operation, see <a href="tfind.html#tfind">tfind</a>.

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>'<dd>No parameters are required.  Stops examining trace frames.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">frame-number</span></samp>'<dd>An integer is required as parameter.  Selects tracepoint frame with
that index.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">tracepoint-number</span></samp>'<dd>An integer is required as parameter.  Finds next
trace frame that corresponds to tracepoint with the specified number.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">pc</span></samp>'<dd>An address is required as parameter.  Finds
next trace frame that corresponds to any tracepoint at the specified
address.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">pc-inside-range</span></samp>'<dd>Two addresses are required as parameters.  Finds next trace
frame that corresponds to a tracepoint at an address inside the
specified range.  Both bounds are considered to be inside the range.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">pc-outside-range</span></samp>'<dd>Two addresses are required as parameters.  Finds
next trace frame that corresponds to a tracepoint at an address outside
the specified range.  Both bounds are considered to be inside the range.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">line</span></samp>'<dd>Line specification is required as parameter.  See <a href="Specify-Location.html#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>. 
Finds next trace frame that corresponds to a tracepoint at
the specified location.

   </dl>

   <p>If `<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>' was passed as <var>mode</var>, the response does not
have fields.  Otherwise, the response may have the following fields:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">found</span></samp>'<dd>This field has either `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>' as the value, depending
on whether a matching tracepoint was found.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">traceframe</span></samp>'<dd>The index of the found traceframe.  This field is present iff
the `<samp><span class="samp">found</span></samp>' field has value of `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">tracepoint</span></samp>'<dd>The index of the found tracepoint.  This field is present iff
the `<samp><span class="samp">found</span></samp>' field has value of `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">frame</span></samp>'<dd>The information about the frame corresponding to the found trace
frame.  This field is present only if a trace frame was found. 
See <a href="GDB_002fMI-Frame-Information.html#GDB_002fMI-Frame-Information">GDB/MI Frame Information</a>, for description of this field.

   </dl>

<h5 class="subsubheading"><span class="sc">gdb</span> Command</h5>

<p>The corresponding <span class="sc">gdb</span> command is `<samp><span class="samp">tfind</span></samp>'.

<h4 class="subheading">-trace-define-variable</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dtrace_002ddefine_002dvariable-2948"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -trace-define-variable <var>name</var> [ <var>value</var> ]
</pre>
   <p>Create trace variable <var>name</var> if it does not exist.  If
<var>value</var> is specified, sets the initial value of the specified
trace variable to that value.  Note that the <var>name</var> should start
with the `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' character.

<h5 class="subsubheading"><span class="sc">gdb</span> Command</h5>

<p>The corresponding <span class="sc">gdb</span> command is `<samp><span class="samp">tvariable</span></samp>'.

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-trace-frame-collected</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dtrace_002dframe_002dcollected-2949"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -trace-frame-collected
         [--var-print-values <var>var_pval</var>]
         [--comp-print-values <var>comp_pval</var>]
         [--registers-format <var>regformat</var>]
         [--memory-contents]
</pre>
   <p>This command returns the set of collected objects, register names,
trace state variable names, memory ranges and computed expressions
that have been collected at a particular trace frame.  The optional
parameters to the command affect the output format in different ways. 
See the output description table below for more details.

   <p>The reported names can be used in the normal manner to create
varobjs and inspect the objects themselves.  The items returned by
this command are categorized so that it is clear which is a variable,
which is a register, which is a trace state variable, which is a
memory range and which is a computed expression.

   <p>For instance, if the actions were
<pre class="smallexample">     collect myVar, myArray[myIndex], myObj.field, myPtr-&gt;field, myCount + 2
     collect *(int*)0xaf02bef0@40
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the object collected in its entirety would be <code>myVar</code>.  The
object <code>myArray</code> would be partially collected, because only the
element at index <code>myIndex</code> would be collected.  The remaining
objects would be computed expressions.

   <p>An example output would be:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb)
     -trace-frame-collected
     ^done,
       explicit-variables=[{name="myVar",value="1"}],
       computed-expressions=[{name="myArray[myIndex]",value="0"},
                             {name="myObj.field",value="0"},
                             {name="myPtr-&gt;field",value="1"},
                             {name="myCount + 2",value="3"},
                             {name="$tvar1 + 1",value="43970027"}],
       registers=[{number="0",value="0x7fe2c6e79ec8"},
                  {number="1",value="0x0"},
                  {number="2",value="0x4"},
                  ...
                  {number="125",value="0x0"}],
       tvars=[{name="$tvar1",current="43970026"}],
       memory=[{address="0x0000000000602264",length="4"},
               {address="0x0000000000615bc0",length="4"}]
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>Where:

     <dl>
<dt><code>explicit-variables</code><dd>The set of objects that have been collected in their entirety (as
opposed to collecting just a few elements of an array or a few struct
members).  For each object, its name and value are printed. 
The <code>--var-print-values</code> option affects how or whether the value
field is output.  If <var>var_pval</var> is 0, then print only the names;
if it is 1, print also their values; and if it is 2, print the name,
type and value for simple data types, and the name and type for
arrays, structures and unions.

     <br><dt><code>computed-expressions</code><dd>The set of computed expressions that have been collected at the
current trace frame.  The <code>--comp-print-values</code> option affects
this set like the <code>--var-print-values</code> option affects the
<code>explicit-variables</code> set.  See above.

     <br><dt><code>registers</code><dd>The registers that have been collected at the current trace frame. 
For each register collected, the name and current value are returned. 
The value is formatted according to the <code>--registers-format</code>
option.  See the <samp><span class="command">-data-list-register-values</span></samp> command for a
list of the allowed formats.  The default is `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><code>tvars</code><dd>The trace state variables that have been collected at the current
trace frame.  For each trace state variable collected, the name and
current value are returned.

     <br><dt><code>memory</code><dd>The set of memory ranges that have been collected at the current trace
frame.  Its content is a list of tuples.  Each tuple represents a
collected memory range and has the following fields:

          <dl>
<dt><code>address</code><dd>The start address of the memory range, as hexadecimal literal.

          <br><dt><code>length</code><dd>The length of the memory range, as decimal literal.

          <br><dt><code>contents</code><dd>The contents of the memory block, in hex.  This field is only present
if the <code>--memory-contents</code> option is specified.

     </dl>

table has the following fields:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">name</span></samp>'<dd>The name of the trace variable.  This field is always present.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">initial</span></samp>'<dd>The initial value.  This is a 64-bit signed integer.  This
field is always present.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">current</span></samp>'<dd>The value the trace variable has at the moment.  This is a 64-bit
signed integer.  This field is absent iff current value is
not defined, for example if the trace was never run, or is
presently running.

   </dl>

<h5 class="subsubheading"><span class="sc">gdb</span> Command</h5>

<p>The corresponding <span class="sc">gdb</span> command is `<samp><span class="samp">tvariables</span></samp>'.

<pre class="smallexample">      -trace-save [-r ] <var>filename</var>
</pre>
   <p>Saves the collected trace data to <var>filename</var>.  Without the
`<samp><span class="samp">-r</span></samp>' option, the data is downloaded from the target and saved
in a local file.  With the `<samp><span class="samp">-r</span></samp>' option the target is asked
to perform the save.

<h5 class="subsubheading"><span class="sc">gdb</span> Command</h5>

supported, `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>', when all tracing operations are supported, or
`<samp><span class="samp">file</span></samp>' when examining trace file.  In the latter case, examining
of trace frame is possible but new tracing experiement cannot be
started.  This field is always present.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">running</span></samp>'<dd>May have a value of either `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>' depending on whether
tracing experiement is in progress on target.  This field is present

remaining space.  These fields are optional.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">circular</span></samp>'<dd>The value of the circular trace buffer flag.  <code>1</code> means that the
trace buffer is circular and old trace frames will be discarded if
necessary to make room, <code>0</code> means that the trace buffer is linear
and may fill up.
