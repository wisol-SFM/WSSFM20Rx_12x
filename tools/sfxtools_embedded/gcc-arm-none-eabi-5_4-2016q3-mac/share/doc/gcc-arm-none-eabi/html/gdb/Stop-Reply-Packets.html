<h3 class="section">E.3 Stop Reply Packets</h3>

<p><a name="index-stop-reply-packets-3355"></a>
The `<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">vCont</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">vAttach</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">vRun</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' packets can
receive any of the below as a reply.  Except for `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>'
and `<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>', that reply is only returned
when the target halts.  In the below the exact meaning of <dfn>signal
number</dfn> is defined by the header <samp><span class="file">include/gdb/signals.h</span></samp> in the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> source code.

   <p>As in the description of request packets, we include spaces in the
reply templates for clarity; these are not part of the reply packet's
syntax.  No <span class="sc">gdb</span> stop reply packet uses spaces to separate its
components.

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">S </span><var>AA</var></samp>'<dd>The program received signal number <var>AA</var> (a two-digit hexadecimal
number).  This is equivalent to a `<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>' response with no
<var>n</var>:<var>r</var> pairs.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">T </span><var>AA</var> <var>n1</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>r1</var><span class="samp">;</span><var>n2</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>r2</var><span class="samp">;...</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bT_007d-packet-reply-3356"></a>The program received signal number <var>AA</var> (a two-digit hexadecimal
number).  This is equivalent to an `<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>' response, except that the
`<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>r</var></samp>' pairs can carry values of important registers
and other information directly in the stop reply packet, reducing
round-trip latency.  Single-step and breakpoint traps are reported
this way.  Each `<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>r</var></samp>' pair is interpreted as follows:

          <ul>
<li>If <var>n</var> is a hexadecimal number, it is a register number, and the
corresponding <var>r</var> gives that register's value.  The data <var>r</var> is a
series of bytes in target byte order, with each byte given by a
two-digit hex number.

          <li>If <var>n</var> is `<samp><span class="samp">thread</span></samp>', then <var>r</var> is the <var>thread-id</var> of
the stopped thread, as specified in <a href="thread_002did-syntax.html#thread_002did-syntax">thread-id syntax</a>.

          <li>If <var>n</var> is `<samp><span class="samp">core</span></samp>', then <var>r</var> is the hexadecimal number of
the core on which the stop event was detected.

          <li>If <var>n</var> is a recognized <dfn>stop reason</dfn>, it describes a more
specific event that stopped the target.  The currently defined stop
reasons are listed below.  The <var>aa</var> should be `<samp><span class="samp">05</span></samp>', the trap
signal.  At most one stop reason should be present.

          <li>Otherwise, <span class="sc">gdb</span> should ignore this `<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>r</var></samp>' pair
and go on to the next; this allows us to extend the protocol in the
future. 
</ul>

     <p>The currently defined stop reasons are:

          <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">watch</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">rwatch</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">awatch</span></samp>'<dd>The packet indicates a watchpoint hit, and <var>r</var> is the data address, in
hex.

          <p><a name="index-shared-library-events_002c-remote-reply-3357"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">library</span></samp>'<dd>The packet indicates that the loaded libraries have changed. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> should use `<samp><span class="samp">qXfer:libraries:read</span></samp>' to fetch a new
list of loaded libraries.  The <var>r</var> part is ignored.

          <p><a name="index-replay-log-events_002c-remote-reply-3358"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">replaylog</span></samp>'<dd>The packet indicates that the target cannot continue replaying
logged execution events, because it has reached the end (or the
beginning when executing backward) of the log.  The value of <var>r</var>
will be either `<samp><span class="samp">begin</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">end</span></samp>'.  See <a href="Reverse-Execution.html#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a>,
for more information.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">swbreak</span></samp>'<dd><a name="swbreak-stop-reason"></a>
The packet indicates a memory breakpoint instruction was executed,
irrespective of whether it was <span class="sc">gdb</span> that planted the
breakpoint or the breakpoint is hardcoded in the program.  The <var>r</var>
part must be left empty.

          <p>On some architectures, such as x86, at the architecture level, when a
breakpoint instruction executes the program counter points at the
breakpoint address plus an offset.  On such targets, the stub is
responsible for adjusting the PC to point back at the breakpoint
address.

          <p>This packet should not be sent by default; older <span class="sc">gdb</span> versions
did not support it.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> requests it, by supplying an
appropriate `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>' feature (see <a href="qSupported.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>).  The
remote stub must also supply the appropriate `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>' feature
indicating support.

          <p>This packet is required for correct non-stop mode operation.

          <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">hwbreak</span></samp>'<dd>The packet indicates the target stopped for a hardware breakpoint. 
The <var>r</var> part must be left empty.

          <p>The same remarks about `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>' and non-stop mode above
apply.

          <p><a name="index-fork-events_002c-remote-reply-3359"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">fork</span></samp>'<dd>The packet indicates that <code>fork</code> was called, and <var>r</var>
is the thread ID of the new child process.  Refer to
<a href="thread_002did-syntax.html#thread_002did-syntax">thread-id syntax</a> for the format of the <var>thread-id</var>
field.  This packet is only applicable to targets that support
fork events.

          <p>This packet should not be sent by default; older <span class="sc">gdb</span> versions
did not support it.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> requests it, by supplying an
appropriate `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>' feature (see <a href="qSupported.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>).  The
remote stub must also supply the appropriate `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>' feature
indicating support.

          <p><a name="index-vfork-events_002c-remote-reply-3360"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">vfork</span></samp>'<dd>The packet indicates that <code>vfork</code> was called, and <var>r</var>
is the thread ID of the new child process. Refer to
<a href="thread_002did-syntax.html#thread_002did-syntax">thread-id syntax</a> for the format of the <var>thread-id</var>
field.  This packet is only applicable to targets that support
vfork events.

          <p>This packet should not be sent by default; older <span class="sc">gdb</span> versions
did not support it.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> requests it, by supplying an
appropriate `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>' feature (see <a href="qSupported.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>).  The
remote stub must also supply the appropriate `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>' feature
indicating support.

          <p><a name="index-vforkdone-events_002c-remote-reply-3361"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">vforkdone</span></samp>'<dd>The packet indicates that a child process created by a vfork
has either called <code>exec</code> or terminated, so that the
address spaces of the parent and child process are no longer
shared. The <var>r</var> part is ignored.  This packet is only
applicable to targets that support vforkdone events.

          <p>This packet should not be sent by default; older <span class="sc">gdb</span> versions
did not support it.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> requests it, by supplying an
appropriate `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>' feature (see <a href="qSupported.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>).  The
remote stub must also supply the appropriate `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>' feature
indicating support.

     </dl>

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">W </span><var>AA</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">W </span><var>AA</var><span class="samp"> ; process:</span><var>pid</var></samp>'<dd>The process exited, and <var>AA</var> is the exit status.  This is only
applicable to certain targets.

     <p>The second form of the response, including the process ID of the exited
process, can be used only when <span class="sc">gdb</span> has reported support for
multiprocess protocol extensions; see <a href="multiprocess-extensions.html#multiprocess-extensions">multiprocess extensions</a>. 
The <var>pid</var> is formatted as a big-endian hex string.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">X </span><var>AA</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">X </span><var>AA</var><span class="samp"> ; process:</span><var>pid</var></samp>'<dd>The process terminated with signal <var>AA</var>.

     <p>The second form of the response, including the process ID of the
terminated process, can be used only when <span class="sc">gdb</span> has reported
support for multiprocess protocol extensions; see <a href="multiprocess-extensions.html#multiprocess-extensions">multiprocess extensions</a>.  The <var>pid</var> is formatted as a big-endian hex string.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">O </span><var>XX</var><span class="samp">...</span></samp>'<dd>`<samp><var>XX</var><span class="samp">...</span></samp>' is hex encoding of <span class="sc">ascii</span> data, to be
written as the program's console output.  This can happen at any time
while the program is running and the debugger should continue to wait
for `<samp><span class="samp">W</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>', etc.  This reply is not permitted in non-stop mode.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">F </span><var>call-id</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>parameter</var><span class="samp">...</span></samp>'<dd><var>call-id</var> is the identifier which says which host system call should
be called.  This is just the name of the function.  Translation into the
correct system call is only applicable as it's defined in <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
See <a href="File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension.html#File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension">File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension</a>, for a list of implemented
system calls.

     <p>`<samp><var>parameter</var><span class="samp">...</span></samp>' is a list of parameters as defined for
this very system call.

     <p>The target replies with this packet when it expects <span class="sc">gdb</span> to
call a host system call on behalf of the target.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> replies
with an appropriate `<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>' packet and keeps up waiting for the next
reply packet from the target.  The latest `<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>'
or `<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>' action is expected to be continued.  See <a href="File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension.html#File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension">File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension</a>, for more details.
