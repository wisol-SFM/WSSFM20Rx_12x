<h3 class="section">14.5 Liveness information</h3>

<p><a name="index-Liveness-representation-3227"></a>Liveness information is useful to determine whether some register is
&ldquo;live&rdquo; at given point of program, i.e. that it contains a value that
may be used at a later point in the program.  This information is
used, for instance, during register allocation, as the pseudo
registers only need to be assigned to a unique hard register or to a
stack slot if they are live.  The hard registers and stack slots may
be freely reused for other values when a register is dead.

 <p>Liveness information is available in the back end starting with
<code>pass_df_initialize</code> and ending with <code>pass_df_finish</code>.  Three
flavors of live analysis are available: With <code>LR</code>, it is possible
to determine at any point <code>P</code> in the function if the register may be
used on some path from <code>P</code> to the end of the function.  With
<code>UR</code>, it is possible to determine if there is a path from the
beginning of the function to <code>P</code> that defines the variable. 
<code>LIVE</code> is the intersection of the <code>LR</code> and <code>UR</code> and a
variable is live at <code>P</code> if there is both an assignment that reaches
it from the beginning of the function and a use that can be reached on
some path from <code>P</code> to the end of the function.

 <p>In general <code>LIVE</code> is the most useful of the three.  The macros
<code>DF_[LR,UR,LIVE]_[IN,OUT]</code> can be used to access this information. 
The macros take a basic block number and return a bitmap that is indexed
by the register number.  This information is only guaranteed to be up to
date after calls are made to <code>df_analyze</code>.  See the file
<code>df-core.c</code> for details on using the dataflow.

 <p><a name="index-REG_005fDEAD_002c-REG_005fUNUSED-3228"></a>The liveness information is stored partly in the RTL instruction stream
and partly in the flow graph.  Local information is stored in the
instruction stream: Each instruction may contain <code>REG_DEAD</code> notes
representing that the value of a given register is no longer needed, or
<code>REG_UNUSED</code> notes representing that the value computed by the
instruction is never used.  The second is useful for instructions
computing multiple values at once.
