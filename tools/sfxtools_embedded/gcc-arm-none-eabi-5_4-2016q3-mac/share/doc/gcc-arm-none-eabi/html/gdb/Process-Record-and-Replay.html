<h2 class="chapter">7 Recording Inferior's Execution and Replaying It</h2>

<p><a name="index-process-record-and-replay-426"></a><a name="index-recording-inferior_0027s-execution-and-replaying-it-427"></a>
On some platforms, <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a special <dfn>process record
and replay</dfn> target that can record a log of the process execution, and
replay it later with both forward and reverse execution commands.

   <p><a name="index-replay-mode-428"></a>When this target is in use, if the execution log includes the record
for the next instruction, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will debug in <dfn>replay
mode</dfn>.  In the replay mode, the inferior does not really execute code
instructions.  Instead, all the events that normally happen during
code execution are taken from the execution log.  While code is not
really executed in replay mode, the values of registers (including the
program counter register) and the memory of the inferior are still
changed as they normally would.  Their contents are taken from the
execution log.

   <p><a name="index-record-mode-429"></a>If the record for the next instruction is not in the execution log,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will debug in <dfn>record mode</dfn>.  In this mode, the
inferior executes normally, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> records the execution log
for future replay.

   <p>The process record and replay target supports reverse execution
(see <a href="Reverse-Execution.html#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a>), even if the platform on which the
inferior runs does not.  However, the reverse execution is limited in
this case by the range of the instructions recorded in the execution
log.  In other words, reverse execution on platforms that don't
support it directly can only be done in the replay mode.

   <p>When debugging in the reverse direction, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will work in
replay mode as long as the execution log includes the record for the
previous instruction; otherwise, it will work in record mode, if the
platform supports reverse execution, or stop if not.

   <p>For architecture environments that support process record and replay,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides the following commands:

     
<a name="index-target-record-430"></a>
<a name="index-target-record_002dfull-431"></a>
<a name="index-target-record_002dbtrace-432"></a>

<a name="index-rec-bts-445"></a>
<a name="index-rec-pt-446"></a>
<dl><dt><code>record </code><var>method</var><dd>This command starts the process record and replay target.  The
recording method can be specified as parameter.  Without a parameter
the command uses the <code>full</code> recording method.  The following
recording methods are available:

          <dl>
<dt><code>full</code><dd>Full record/replay recording using <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s software record and
replay implementation.  This method allows replaying and reverse
execution.

          <br><dt><code>btrace </code><var>format</var><dd>Hardware-supported instruction recording.  This method does not record
data.  Further, the data is collected in a ring buffer so old data will
be overwritten when the buffer is full.  It allows limited reverse
execution.  Variables and registers are not available during reverse
execution.

          <p>The recording format can be specified as parameter.  Without a parameter
the command chooses the recording format.  The following recording
formats are available:

               <dl>
<dt><code>bts</code><dd><a name="index-branch-trace-store-447"></a>Use the <dfn>Branch Trace Store</dfn> (<acronym>BTS</acronym>) recording format.  In
this format, the processor stores a from/to record for each executed
branch in the btrace ring buffer.

               <br><dt><code>pt</code><dd><a name="index-Intel_0028R_0029-Processor-Trace-448"></a>Use the <dfn>Intel(R) Processor Trace</dfn> recording format.  In this
format, the processor stores the execution trace in a compressed form
that is afterwards decoded by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

               <p>The trace can be recorded with very low overhead.  The compressed
trace format also allows small trace buffers to already contain a big
number of instructions compared to <acronym>BTS</acronym>.

               <p>Decoding the recorded execution trace, on the other hand, is more
expensive than decoding <acronym>BTS</acronym> trace.  This is mostly due to the
increased number of instructions to process.  You should increase the
buffer-size with care. 
</dl>

          <p>Not all recording formats may be available on all processors. 
</dl>

     <p>The process record and replay target can only debug a process that is
already running.  Therefore, you need first to start the process with
the <kbd>run</kbd> or <kbd>start</kbd> commands, and then start the recording
with the <kbd>record </kbd><var>method</var> command.

     <p><a name="index-displaced-stepping_002c-and-process-record-and-replay-449"></a>Displaced stepping (see <a href="Maintenance-Commands.html#Maintenance-Commands">displaced stepping</a>)
will be automatically disabled when process record and replay target
is started.  That's because the process record and replay target
doesn't support displaced stepping.

     <p><a name="index-non_002dstop-mode_002c-and-process-record-and-replay-450"></a><a name="index-asynchronous-execution_002c-and-process-record-and-replay-451"></a>If the inferior is in the non-stop mode (see <a href="Non_002dStop-Mode.html#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>) or in
the asynchronous execution mode (see <a href="Background-Execution.html#Background-Execution">Background Execution</a>), not
all recording methods are available.  The <code>full</code> recording method
does not support these two modes.

     <p><a name="index-record-stop-452"></a><a name="index-rec-s-453"></a><br><dt><code>record stop</code><dd>Stop the process record and replay target.  When process record and
replay target stops, the entire execution log will be deleted and the
inferior will either be terminated, or will remain in its final state.

     <p>When you stop the process record and replay target in record mode (at
the end of the execution log), the inferior will be stopped at the
next instruction that would have been recorded.  In other words, if
you record for a while and then stop recording, the inferior process
will be left in the same state as if the recording never happened.

     <p>On the other hand, if the process record and replay target is stopped
while in replay mode (that is, not at the end of the execution log,
but at some earlier point), the inferior process will become &ldquo;live&rdquo;
at that earlier state, and it will then be possible to continue the
usual &ldquo;live&rdquo; debugging of the process from that state.

     <p>When the inferior process exits, or <span class="sc">gdb</span> detaches from it,
process record and replay target will automatically stop itself.

     <p><a name="index-record-goto-454"></a><br><dt><code>record goto</code><dd>Go to a specific location in the execution log.  There are several
ways to specify the location to go to:

          <dl>
<dt><code>record goto begin</code><dt><code>record goto start</code><dd>Go to the beginning of the execution log.

          <br><dt><code>record goto end</code><dd>Go to the end of the execution log.

          <br><dt><code>record goto </code><var>n</var><dd>Go to instruction number <var>n</var> in the execution log. 
</dl>

     <p><a name="index-record-save-455"></a><br><dt><code>record save </code><var>filename</var><dd>Save the execution log to a file <samp><var>filename</var></samp>. 
Default filename is <samp><span class="file">gdb_record.</span><var>process_id</var></samp>, where
<var>process_id</var> is the process ID of the inferior.

     <p>This command may not be available for all recording methods.

     <p><a name="index-record-restore-456"></a><br><dt><code>record restore </code><var>filename</var><dd>Restore the execution log from a file <samp><var>filename</var></samp>. 
File must have been created with <code>record save</code>.

     <p><a name="index-set-record-full-457"></a><br><dt><code>set record full insn-number-max </code><var>limit</var><dt><code>set record full insn-number-max unlimited</code><dd>Set the limit of instructions to be recorded for the <code>full</code>
recording method.  Default value is 200000.

     <p>If <var>limit</var> is a positive number, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will start
deleting instructions from the log once the number of the record
instructions becomes greater than <var>limit</var>.  For every new recorded
instruction, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will delete the earliest recorded
instruction to keep the number of recorded instructions at the limit. 
(Since deleting recorded instructions loses information, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
lets you control what happens when the limit is reached, by means of
the <code>stop-at-limit</code> option, described below.)

     <p>If <var>limit</var> is <code>unlimited</code> or zero, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will never
delete recorded instructions from the execution log.  The number of
recorded instructions is limited only by the available memory.

     <p><a name="index-show-record-full-458"></a><br><dt><code>show record full insn-number-max</code><dd>Show the limit of instructions to be recorded with the <code>full</code>
recording method.

     <br><dt><code>set record full stop-at-limit</code><dd>Control the behavior of the  <code>full</code> recording method when the
number of recorded instructions reaches the limit.  If ON (the
default), <span class="sc">gdb</span> will stop when the limit is reached for the
first time and ask you whether you want to stop the inferior or
continue running it and recording the execution log.  If you decide
to continue recording, each new recorded instruction will cause the
oldest one to be deleted.

     <p>If this option is OFF, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will automatically delete the
oldest record to make room for each new one, without asking.

     <br><dt><code>show record full stop-at-limit</code><dd>Show the current setting of <code>stop-at-limit</code>.

     <br><dt><code>set record full memory-query</code><dd>Control the behavior when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is unable to record memory
changes caused by an instruction for the <code>full</code> recording method. 
If ON, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will query whether to stop the inferior in that
case.

     <p>If this option is OFF (the default), <span class="sc">gdb</span> will automatically
ignore the effect of such instructions on memory.  Later, when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> replays this execution log, it will mark the log of this
instruction as not accessible, and it will not affect the replay
results.

     <br><dt><code>show record full memory-query</code><dd>Show the current setting of <code>memory-query</code>.

     <p><a name="index-set-record-btrace-459"></a>The <code>btrace</code> record target does not trace data.  As a
convenience, when replaying, <span class="sc">gdb</span> reads read-only memory off
the live program directly, assuming that the addresses of the
read-only areas don't change.  This for example makes it possible to
disassemble code while replaying, but not to print variables. 
In some cases, being able to inspect variables might be useful. 
You can use the following command for that:

     <br><dt><code>set record btrace replay-memory-access</code><dd>Control the behavior of the <code>btrace</code> recording method when
accessing memory during replay.  If <code>read-only</code> (the default),
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will only allow accesses to read-only memory. 
If <code>read-write</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will allow accesses to read-only
and to read-write memory.  Beware that the accessed memory corresponds
to the live target and not necessarily to the current replay
position.

     <p><a name="index-show-record-btrace-460"></a><br><dt><code>show record btrace replay-memory-access</code><dd>Show the current setting of <code>replay-memory-access</code>.

     <p><a name="index-set-record-btrace-bts-461"></a><br><dt><code>set record btrace bts buffer-size </code><var>size</var><dt><code>set record btrace bts buffer-size unlimited</code><dd>Set the requested ring buffer size for branch tracing in <acronym>BTS</acronym>
format.  Default is 64KB.

     <p>If <var>size</var> is a positive number, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will try to
allocate a buffer of at least <var>size</var> bytes for each new thread
that uses the btrace recording method and the <acronym>BTS</acronym> format. 
The actually obtained buffer size may differ from the requested
<var>size</var>.  Use the <code>info record</code> command to see the actual
buffer size for each thread that uses the btrace recording method and
the <acronym>BTS</acronym> format.

     <p>If <var>limit</var> is <code>unlimited</code> or zero, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will try to
allocate a buffer of 4MB.

     <p>Bigger buffers mean longer traces.  On the other hand, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
also need longer to process the branch trace data before it can be used.

     <br><dt><code>show record btrace bts buffer-size </code><var>size</var><dd>Show the current setting of the requested ring buffer size for branch
