<h3 class="section">3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiler-options_002c-C_002b_002b-144"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-options_002c-command_002dline-145"></a><a name="index-options_002c-C_002b_002b-146"></a>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs.  You can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <samp><span class="file">firstClass.C</span></samp> like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">In this example, only <samp><span class="option">-frepo</span></samp> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.

 <p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fabi-version=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fabi_002dversion-147"></a>Use version <var>n</var> of the C++ ABI.  The default is version 0.

     <p>Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the C++ ABI specification.  Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed.

     <p>Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.

     <p>Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++
3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9.

     <p>Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.

     <p>Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.

     <p>Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.

     <p>Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and &ndash;, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.

     <p>Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a
builtin type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument
scope.

     <p>Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution
behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers.

     <p>Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of
<code>nullptr_t</code>.

     <p>See also <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fabi-compat-version=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fabi_002dcompat_002dversion-148"></a>On targets that support strong aliases, G++
works around mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct
mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled name. 
This switch specifies which ABI version to use for the alias.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=0</span></samp> (the default), this defaults to 2.  If
another ABI version is explicitly selected, this defaults to 0.

     <p>The compatibility version is also set by <samp><span class="option">-Wabi=</span><var>n</var></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-access-control</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002daccess_002dcontrol-149"></a>Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.

     <br><dt><code>-fcheck-new</code><dd><a name="index-fcheck_002dnew-150"></a>Check that the pointer returned by <code>operator new</code> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
<code>operator new</code> only returns <code>0</code> if it is declared
<code>throw()</code>, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<code>operator new</code> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <code>std::bad_alloc</code>.  See also
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">new (nothrow)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-fconstexpr-depth=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fconstexpr_002ddepth-151"></a>Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions
to <var>n</var>.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.

     <br><dt><code>-fdeduce-init-list</code><dd><a name="index-fdeduce_002dinit_002dlist-152"></a>Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
<code>std::initializer_list</code> from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.

     <pre class="smallexample">          template &lt;class T&gt; auto forward(T t) -&gt; decltype (realfn (t))
          {
            return realfn (t);
          }
          
          void f()
          {
            forward({1,2}); // call forward&lt;std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&gt;
          }
</pre>
     <p>This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
originally proposed semantics for the C++11 standard, but was not part
of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.  This option is
deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of G++.

     <br><dt><code>-ffriend-injection</code><dd><a name="index-ffriend_002dinjection-153"></a>Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared. 
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
C++ Reference Manual. 
However, in ISO C++ a friend function that is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  GCC defaults to the standard behavior.

     <p>This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-elide-constructors</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002delide_002dconstructors-154"></a>The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type. 
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002denforce_002deh_002dspecs-155"></a>Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
<code>NDEBUG</code>.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.

     <br><dt><code>-fextern-tls-init</code><dt><code>-fno-extern-tls-init</code><dd><a name="index-fextern_002dtls_002dinit-156"></a><a name="index-fno_002dextern_002dtls_002dinit-157"></a>The C++11 and OpenMP standards allow <code>thread_local</code> and
<code>threadprivate</code> variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization. 
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses in
another TU), they can avoid this overhead with the
<samp><span class="option">-fno-extern-tls-init</span></samp> option.

     <p>On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
<samp><span class="option">-fextern-tls-init</span></samp>.  On targets that do not support symbol
aliases, the default is <samp><span class="option">-fno-extern-tls-init</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-ffor-scope</code><dt><code>-fno-for-scope</code><dd><a name="index-ffor_002dscope-158"></a><a name="index-fno_002dfor_002dscope-159"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-ffor-scope</span></samp> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> is limited to the <code>for</code> loop itself,
as specified by the C++ standard. 
If <samp><span class="option">-fno-for-scope</span></samp> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++.

     <p>If neither flag is given, the default is to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dgnu_002dkeywords-160"></a>Do not recognize <code>typeof</code> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <code>__typeof__</code> instead. 
<samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> implies <samp><span class="option">-fno-gnu-keywords</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dtemplates-161"></a>Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations. 
See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dinline_002dtemplates-162"></a>Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either. 
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization need the same set of explicit instantiations.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implement-inlines</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplement_002dinlines-163"></a>To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <code>#pragma implementation</code>.  This causes linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.

     <br><dt><code>-fms-extensions</code><dd><a name="index-fms_002dextensions-164"></a>Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-nonansi-builtins</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dnonansi_002dbuiltins-165"></a>Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
ANSI/ISO C.  These include <code>ffs</code>, <code>alloca</code>, <code>_exit</code>,
<code>index</code>, <code>bzero</code>, <code>conjf</code>, and other related functions.

     <br><dt><code>-fnothrow-opt</code><dd><a name="index-fnothrow_002dopt-166"></a>Treat a <code>throw()</code> exception specification as if it were a
<code>noexcept</code> specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
function smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification results in a call
to <code>terminate</code> rather than <code>unexpected</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-operator-names</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002doperator_002dnames-167"></a>Do not treat the operator name keywords <code>and</code>, <code>bitand</code>,
<code>bitor</code>, <code>compl</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code> as
synonyms as keywords.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-optional-diags</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002doptional_002ddiags-168"></a>Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.

     <br><dt><code>-fpermissive</code><dd><a name="index-fpermissive-169"></a>Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using <samp><span class="option">-fpermissive</span></samp> allows some
nonconforming code to compile.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-pretty-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dpretty_002dtemplates-170"></a>When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. <code>void f(T) [with T = int]</code>
rather than <code>void f(int)</code>) so that it's clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, you can use <samp><span class="option">-fno-pretty-templates</span></samp> to disable them.

     <br><dt><code>-frepo</code><dd><a name="index-frepo-171"></a>Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies <samp><span class="option">-fno-implicit-templates</span></samp>.  See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-rtti</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002drtti-172"></a>Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C++ run-time type identification features
(<code>dynamic_cast</code> and <code>typeid</code>).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The <code>dynamic_cast</code> operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to <code>void *</code> or to
unambiguous base classes.

     <br><dt><code>-fsized-deallocation</code><dd><a name="index-fsized_002ddeallocation-173"></a>Enable the built-in global declarations
     <pre class="smallexample">          void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
          void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
</pre>
     <p>as introduced in C++14.  This is useful for user-defined replacement
deallocation functions that, for example, use the size of the object
to make deallocation faster.  Enabled by default under
<samp><span class="option">-std=c++14</span></samp> and above.  The flag <samp><span class="option">-Wsized-deallocation</span></samp>
warns about places that might want to add a definition.

     <br><dt><code>-fstats</code><dd><a name="index-fstats-174"></a>Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation. 
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-enums</code><dd><a name="index-fstrict_002denums-175"></a>Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the C++ standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.

     <br><dt><code>-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-ftemplate_002dbacktrace_002dlimit-176"></a>Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a single
warning or error to <var>n</var>.  The default value is 10.

     <br><dt><code>-ftemplate-depth=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-ftemplate_002ddepth-177"></a>Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <var>n</var>. 
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17
(changed to 1024 in C++11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler
can run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some situations.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-threadsafe-statics</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dthreadsafe_002dstatics-178"></a>Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C++
ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.

     <br><dt><code>-fuse-cxa-atexit</code><dd><a name="index-fuse_002dcxa_002datexit-179"></a>Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
<code>__cxa_atexit</code> function rather than the <code>atexit</code> function. 
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but only works if your C library supports
<code>__cxa_atexit</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002duse_002dcxa_002dget_002dexception_002dptr-180"></a>Don't use the <code>__cxa_get_exception_ptr</code> runtime routine.  This
causes <code>std::uncaught_exception</code> to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.

     <br><dt><code>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</code><dd><a name="index-fvisibility_002dinlines_002dhidden-181"></a>This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.

     <p>The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with
<code>__attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))</code> so that they do not
appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT indirection
when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.

     <p>The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.

     <p>You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.

     <p>Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary. 
See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-fvisibility-ms-compat</code><dd><a name="index-fvisibility_002dms_002dcompat-182"></a>This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.

     <p>The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>It sets the default visibility to <code>hidden</code>, like
<samp><span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span></samp>.

          <li>Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.

          <li>The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
          </ol>

     <p>In new code it is better to use <samp><span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span></samp> and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible. 
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.

     <p>Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the ODR to define types with the same name differently.

     <br><dt><code>-fvtable-verify=</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>std</code><span class="roman">|</span><code>preinit</code><span class="roman">|</span><code>none</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd><a name="index-fvtable_002dverify-183"></a>Turn on (or off, if using <samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=none</span></samp>) the security
feature that verifies at run time, for every virtual call, that
the vtable pointer through which the call is made is valid for the type of
the object, and has not been corrupted or overwritten.  If an invalid vtable
pointer is detected at run time, an error is reported and execution of the
program is immediately halted.

     <p>This option causes run-time data structures to be built at program startup,
which are used for verifying the vtable pointers. 
The options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">std</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">preinit</span></samp>&rsquo;
control the timing of when these data structures are built.  In both cases the
data structures are built before execution reaches <code>main</code>.  Using
<samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=std</span></samp> causes the data structures to be built after
shared libraries have been loaded and initialized. 
<samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=preinit</span></samp> causes them to be built before shared
libraries have been loaded and initialized.

     <p>If this option appears multiple times in the command line with different
values specified, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo; takes highest priority over both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">std</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">preinit</span></samp>&rsquo;; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">preinit</span></samp>&rsquo; takes priority over &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">std</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-fvtv-debug</code><dd><a name="index-fvtv_002ddebug-184"></a>When used in conjunction with <samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=std</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=preinit</span></samp>, causes debug versions of the
runtime functions for the vtable verification feature to be called. 
This flag also causes the compiler to log information about which
vtable pointers it finds for each class. 
This information is written to a file named <samp><span class="file">vtv_set_ptr_data.log</span></samp>
in the directory named by the environment variable <samp><span class="env">VTV_LOGS_DIR</span></samp>
if that is defined or the current working directory otherwise.

     <p>Note:  This feature <em>appends</em> data to the log file. If you want a fresh log
file, be sure to delete any existing one.

     <br><dt><code>-fvtv-counts</code><dd><a name="index-fvtv_002dcounts-185"></a>This is a debugging flag.  When used in conjunction with
<samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=std</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=preinit</span></samp>, this
causes the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual calls
it encounters and the number of verifications it inserts.  It also
counts the number of calls to certain run-time library functions
that it inserts and logs this information for each compilation unit. 
The compiler writes this information to a file named
<samp><span class="file">vtv_count_data.log</span></samp> in the directory named by the environment

     <br><dt><code>-fno-weak</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dweak-186"></a>Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker. 
By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it results in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.

     <br><dt><code>-nostdinc++</code><dd><a name="index-nostdinc_002b_002b-187"></a>Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to

</dl>

 <p>In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-Wabi </code><span class="roman">(C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wabi-188"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dabi-189"></a>When an explicit <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=</span><var>n</var></samp> option is used, causes
G++ to warn when it generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral C++ ABI.  Since G++ now defaults to
<samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=0</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp> has no effect unless either
an older ABI version is selected (with <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=</span><var>n</var></samp>)
or an older compatibility version is selected (with
<samp><span class="option">-Wabi=</span><var>n</var></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fabi-compat-version=</span><var>n</var></samp>).

     <p>Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
is compatible.

     <p>You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp> can also be used with an explicit version number to
warn about compatibility with a particular <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version</span></samp>
level, e.g. <samp><span class="option">-Wabi=2</span></samp> to warn about changes relative to
<samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=2</span></samp>.  Specifying a version number also sets
<samp><span class="option">-fabi-compat-version=</span><var>n</var></samp>.

     <p>The known incompatibilities in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=2</span></samp> (which was the
default from GCC 3.4 to 4.9) include:

          <ul>
<li>A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type was
mangled incorrectly:
          <pre class="smallexample">               extern int N;
               template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {};
               void n (S&lt;N&gt;) {2}
</pre>
          <p>This was fixed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=3</span></samp>.

          <li>SIMD vector types declared using <code>__attribute ((vector_size))</code> were
mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of
functions taking vectors of different sizes.

          <p>The mangling was changed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=4</span></samp>.

          <li><code>__attribute ((const))</code> and <code>noreturn</code> were mangled as type
qualifiers, and <code>decltype</code> of a plain declaration was folded away.

          <p>These mangling issues were fixed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=5</span></samp>.

          <li>Scoped enumerators passed as arguments to a variadic function are
promoted like unscoped enumerators, causing <code>va_arg</code> to complain. 
On most targets this does not actually affect the parameter passing
ABI, as there is no way to pass an argument smaller than <code>int</code>.

          <p>Also, the ABI changed the mangling of template argument packs,
<code>const_cast</code>, <code>static_cast</code>, prefix increment/decrement, and
a class scope function used as a template argument.

          <p>These issues were corrected in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=6</span></samp>.

          <li>Lambdas in default argument scope were mangled incorrectly, and the
ABI changed the mangling of <code>nullptr_t</code>.

          <p>These issues were corrected in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=7</span></samp>.

          <li>When mangling a function type with function-cv-qualifiers, the
un-qualified function type was incorrectly treated as a substitution
candidate.

          <p>This was fixed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=8</span></samp>, the default for GCC 5.1.

          <li><code>decltype(nullptr)</code> incorrectly had an alignment of 1, leading to
unaligned accesses.  Note that this did not affect the ABI of a
function with a <code>nullptr_t</code> parameter, as parameters have a
minimum alignment.

          <p>This was fixed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=9</span></samp>, the default for GCC 5.2. 
</ul>

     <p>It also warns about psABI-related changes.  The known psABI changes at this
point include:

          <ul>
<li>For SysV/x86-64, unions with <code>long double</code> members are
passed in memory as specified in psABI.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               union U {
                 long double ld;
                 int i;
               };
</pre>
          <p class="noindent"><code>union U</code> is always passed in memory.

support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
