<h3 class="section">3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h3>

<p><a name="index-options-to-control-warnings-275"></a><a name="index-warning-messages-276"></a><a name="index-messages_002c-warning-277"></a><a name="index-suppressing-warnings-278"></a>
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.

 <p>The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.

     
<a name="index-syntax-checking-279"></a>
<dl><dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code><dd><a name="index-fsyntax_002donly-280"></a>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

     <br><dt><code>-fmax-errors=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fmax_002derrors-281"></a>Limits the maximum number of error messages to <var>n</var>, at which point
GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If <var>n</var> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If <samp><span class="option">-Wfatal-errors</span></samp> is also
specified, then <samp><span class="option">-Wfatal-errors</span></samp> takes precedence over this
option.

     <br><dt><code>-w</code><dd><a name="index-w-282"></a>Inhibit all warning messages.

     <br><dt><code>-Werror</code><dd><a name="index-Werror-283"></a><a name="index-Wno_002derror-284"></a>Make all warnings into errors.

     <br><dt><code>-Werror=</code><dd><a name="index-Werror_003d-285"></a><a name="index-Wno_002derror_003d-286"></a>Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example <samp><span class="option">-Werror=switch</span></samp> turns the warnings
controlled by <samp><span class="option">-Wswitch</span></samp> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <samp><span class="option">-Werror</span></samp> for specific
warnings; for example <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=switch</span></samp> makes
<samp><span class="option">-Wswitch</span></samp> warnings not be errors, even when <samp><span class="option">-Werror</span></samp>
is in effect.

     <p>The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
<samp><span class="option">-Werror=</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=</span></samp> as described above. 
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
<samp><span class="option">-fno-diagnostics-show-option</span></samp> flag.)

     <p>Note that specifying <samp><span class="option">-Werror=</span></samp><var>foo</var> automatically implies
<samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp><var>foo</var>.  However, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=</span></samp><var>foo</var> does not
imply anything.

     <br><dt><code>-Wfatal-errors</code><dd><a name="index-Wfatal_002derrors-287"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dfatal_002derrors-288"></a>This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.

 </dl>

 <p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>&rsquo;, for example <samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit</span></samp> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Wno-</span></samp>&rsquo; to turn off warnings; for
example, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-implicit</span></samp>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and
<a href="Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.

 <p>Some options, such as <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp>, turn on other
options, such as <samp><span class="option">-Wunused</span></samp>, which may turn on further options,
such as <samp><span class="option">-Wunused-value</span></samp>. The combined effect of positive and
negative forms is that more specific options have priority over less
specific ones, independently of their position in the command-line. For
options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options
enabled or disabled via pragmas (see <a href="Diagnostic-Pragmas.html#Diagnostic-Pragmas">Diagnostic Pragmas</a>) take effect
as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.

 <p>When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<samp><span class="option">-Wunknown-warning</span></samp>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <samp><span class="option">-Wno-</span></samp> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for <samp><span class="option">-Wno-unknown-warning</span></samp> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new <samp><span class="option">-Wno-</span></samp> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-Wpedantic</code><dt><code>-pedantic</code><dd><a name="index-pedantic-289"></a><a name="index-Wpedantic-290"></a>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option used.

     <p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> or a
<samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them. 
See <a href="Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

     <p>Some users try to use <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all&mdash;only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.

     <p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.

     <p>Where the standard specified with <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu90</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu99</span></samp>&rsquo;, there is a
corresponding <dfn>base standard</dfn>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

     <br><dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code><dd><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-291"></a>Give an error whenever the <dfn>base standard</dfn> (see <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp>)
requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior
at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation
of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not
equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-Werror=pedantic</span></samp>, since there are errors enabled
by this option and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.

     <br><dt><code>-Wall</code><dd><a name="index-Wall-292"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dall-293"></a>This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and <a href="Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> turns on the following warning flags:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -Waddress

</pre>
     <p>Note that some warning flags are not implied by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp> but many of
them must be enabled individually.

     <br><dt><code>-Wextra</code><dd><a name="index-W-294"></a><a name="index-Wextra-295"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dextra-296"></a>This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by
<samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>. (This option used to be called <samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp>.  The older

</pre>
     <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp> also prints warning messages for the
following cases:

          <ul>
<li>A pointer is compared against integer zero with <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>,
<code>&gt;</code>, or <code>&gt;=</code>.

          <li>(C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a
conditional expression.

          <li>(C++ only) Ambiguous virtual bases.

          <li>(C++ only) Subscripting an array that has been declared <code>register</code>.

          <li>(C++ only) Taking the address of a variable that has been declared
<code>register</code>.

          <li>(C++ only) A base class is not initialized in a derived class's copy
constructor.

     </ul>

     <br><dt><code>-Wchar-subscripts</code><dd><a name="index-Wchar_002dsubscripts-297"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dchar_002dsubscripts-298"></a>Warn if an array subscript has type <code>char</code>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines. 
This warning is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wcomment</code><dd><a name="index-Wcomment-299"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dcomment-300"></a>Warn whenever a comment-start sequence &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo;
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>&rsquo; comment. 
This warning is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</code><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dcoverage_002dmismatch-301"></a>Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp> option. 
If a source file is changed between compiling with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-gen</span></samp> and
with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>, the files with the profile feedback can fail
to match the source file and GCC cannot use the profile feedback
information.  By default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an
error.  <samp><span class="option">-Wno-coverage-mismatch</span></samp> can be used to disable the
warning or <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</span></samp> can be used to
disable the error.  Disabling the error for this warning can result in
poorly optimized code and is useful only in the
case of very minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing code-base. 
Completely disabling the warning is not recommended.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-cpp</code><dd><span class="roman">(C, Objective-C, C++, Objective-C++ and Fortran only)</span>

     <p>Suppress warning messages emitted by <code>#warning</code> directives.

     <br><dt><code>-Wdouble-promotion </code><span class="roman">(C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wdouble_002dpromotion-302"></a><a name="index-Wno_002ddouble_002dpromotion-303"></a>Give a warning when a value of type <code>float</code> is implicitly
promoted to <code>double</code>.  CPUs with a 32-bit &ldquo;single-precision&rdquo;
floating-point unit implement <code>float</code> in hardware, but emulate
<code>double</code> in software.  On such a machine, doing computations
using <code>double</code> values is much more expensive because of the
overhead required for software emulation.

     <p>It is easy to accidentally do computations with <code>double</code> because
floating-point literals are implicitly of type <code>double</code>.  For
example, in:
     <pre class="smallexample">          float area(float radius)
          {
             return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
          }
</pre>
     <p>the compiler performs the entire computation with <code>double</code>
because the floating-point literal is a <code>double</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wformat</code><dt><code>-Wformat=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-Wformat-304"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dformat-305"></a><a name="index-ffreestanding-306"></a><a name="index-fno_002dbuiltin-307"></a><a name="index-Wformat_003d-308"></a>Check calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), in the <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> and <code>strfmon</code> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families). 
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
<samp><span class="option">-ffreestanding</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin</span></samp>.

     <p>The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> is used
with <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>, warnings are given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for <code>strfmon</code> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

          <dl>

<samp><span class="option">-Wno-format</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-Wformat=0</span></samp>.  Since
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> also checks for null format arguments for several
functions, <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> also implies <samp><span class="option">-Wnonnull</span></samp>.  Some
aspects of this level of format checking can be disabled by the
options: <samp><span class="option">-Wno-format-contains-nul</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-format-extra-args</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-Wno-format-zero-length</span></samp>. 
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

<code>printf</code> or <code>scanf</code> format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.

          <p>Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to <code>va_arg</code> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of <code>scanf</code> formats, this option suppresses the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.

          <br><dt><code>-Wno-format-zero-length</code><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002dzero_002dlength-315"></a><a name="index-Wformat_002dzero_002dlength-316"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.

functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> functions where the

as in <code>printf (foo);</code>.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%n</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (This is

as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.

     <p>Also warn if a comparison like <code>x&lt;=y&lt;=z</code> appears; this is
equivalent to <code>(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z</code>, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

     <p>Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<code>if</code> statement an <code>else</code> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            if (a)
              if (b)
                foo ();
            else
              bar ();
          }
</pre>
     <p>In C/C++, every <code>else</code> branch belongs to the innermost possible
<code>if</code> statement, which in this example is <code>if (b)</code>.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost <code>if</code> statement so there is no way the <code>else</code>
can belong to the enclosing <code>if</code>.  The resulting code
looks like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            if (a)
              {
                if (b)
                  foo ();
                else
                  bar ();
              }
          }
</pre>
     <p>Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to
<code>?:</code> with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the <code>?</code>: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.

     <br><dt><code>-Wsequence-point</code><dd><a name="index-Wsequence_002dpoint-346"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dsequence_002dpoint-347"></a>Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.

     <p>The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of <dfn>sequence points</dfn>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>? :</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places. 
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.

     <p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that &ldquo;Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. 
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.&rdquo;.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.

     <p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a = a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
= b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++] = i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.

     <p>The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases. 
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at

entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the compiler
emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not
executed at run time. These warnings are made optional because GCC is
not smart enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            int x;
            switch (y)
              {

            foo (x);
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If the value of <code>y</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>x</code> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with assert(0) or
similar code.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-warnings-391"></a>This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <code>longjmp</code>.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.

     <p>The compiler sees only the calls to <code>setjmp</code>.  It cannot know
where <code>longjmp</code> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <code>longjmp</code> cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.

     <p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <code>noreturn</code>.  See <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

compiler is using for optimization. 
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives). 
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>
works. 
<samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-aliasing</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-aliasing=3</span></samp>.

     <p>Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate. 
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but <samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp> still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives. 
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.

     <p>Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise. 
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1). 
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.

     <p>Level 3 (default for <samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-aliasing</span></samp>):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled. 
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
<code>*(int*)&amp;some_float</code>. 
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information. 
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced. 
Does not warn about incomplete types.

It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.

     <p>An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.

          <dl>
<dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=1</code><dd>Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example,  with <samp><span class="option">-fstrict-overflow</span></samp>, the compiler simplifies
<code>x + 1 &gt; x</code> to <code>1</code>.  This level of
<samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-overflow</span></samp> is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=2</code><dd>Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: <code>abs (x) &gt;= 0</code>.  This can only be
simplified when <samp><span class="option">-fstrict-overflow</span></samp> is in effect, because
<code>abs (INT_MIN)</code> overflows to <code>INT_MIN</code>, which is less than
zero.  <samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-overflow</span></samp> (with no level) is the same as
<samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-overflow=2</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=3</code><dd>Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: <code>x + 1 &gt; 1</code> is simplified to <code>x &gt; 0</code>.

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=4</code><dd>Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases. 
For example: <code>(x * 10) / 5</code> is simplified to <code>x * 2</code>.

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=5</code><dd>Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: <code>x + 2 &gt; y</code> is
simplified to <code>x + 1 &gt;= y</code>.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large number of
false positives.

Warn about functions that might be candidates for attributes
<code>pure</code>, <code>const</code> or <code>noreturn</code>.  The compiler only warns for
functions visible in other compilation units or (in the case of <code>pure</code> and
<code>const</code>) if it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A function
returns normally if it doesn't contain an infinite loop or return abnormally
by throwing, calling <code>abort</code> or trapping.  This analysis requires option
<samp><span class="option">-fipa-pure-const</span></samp>, which is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and

Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for <code>format</code>
attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones. 
GCC guesses that function pointers with <code>format</code> attributes that
are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding <code>format</code> attribute in the
resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type
of the containing function respectively should also have a <code>format</code>
attribute to avoid the warning.

          <p>GCC also warns about function definitions that might be
candidates for <code>format</code> attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  GCC guesses that <code>format</code> attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like
<code>vprintf</code> or <code>vscanf</code>, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which <code>format</code> attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.

A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run

used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it is

     <p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.

          <ul>
<li>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body. 
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in ISO C it does not.

          <li>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist. 
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional</span></samp> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<code>#pragma</code> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize <code>#elif</code>, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.

          <li>A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

          <li>The unary plus operator.

          <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">U</span></samp>&rsquo; integer constant suffix, or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_MIN</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_MAX</span></samp>&rsquo; macros in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>. 
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

          <li>A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

          <li>A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

          <li>A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one. 
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.

          <li>The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

          <li>Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

          <li>Initialization of automatic aggregates.

          <li>Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.

          <li>Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code>__STDC__</code> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.

          <li>Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use <samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional-conversion</span></samp>.

          <li>Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, <code>PARAMS</code> and
<code>VPARAMS</code>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some <dfn>normalization rules</dfn> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.

     <p>There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=nfc</span></samp>, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the ISO 10646 &ldquo;C&rdquo; normalized form, <dfn>NFC</dfn>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.  It is equivalent to
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized</span></samp>.

     <p>Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC. 
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=id</span></samp> suppresses the warning for these characters. 
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.

     <p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=none</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-Wno-normalized</span></samp>.  You should
only do this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like
&ldquo;D&rdquo;), because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
literally impossible to see.

     <p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <code>\u207F</code>, &ldquo;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N&rdquo;, displays just like a regular <code>n</code> that has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <dfn>NFKC</dfn>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC warns if your code is not in NFKC if you use
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=nfkc</span></samp>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure. 
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable <code>f.x</code> in <code>struct bar</code>
is misaligned even though <code>struct bar</code> does not itself
have the packed attribute:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo {
            int x;
            char a, b, c, d;

on bit-fields of type <code>char</code>.  This has been fixed in GCC 4.4 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  GCC
informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in GCC 4.4. 
For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding between field <code>a</code>
and <code>b</code> in this structure:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo
          {
            char a:4;
            char b:8;
          } __attribute__ ((packed));

     <p>This warning is enabled by default.  Use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat</span></samp> to disable this warning.

     <br><dt><code>-Wpadded</code><dd><a name="index-Wpadded-583"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dpadded-584"></a>Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.

base class inherited from has a C variadic constructor; the warning is
on by default because the ellipsis is not inherited.

     <br><dt><code>-Winline</code><dd><a name="index-Winline-591"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dinline-592"></a>Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined. 
Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.

     <p>The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by <samp><span class="option">-Winline</span></samp> to appear or disappear.

type.  According to the 2014 ISO C++ standard, applying <code>offsetof</code>
to a non-standard-layout type is undefined.  In existing C++ implementations,
however, <code>offsetof</code> typically gives meaningful results. 
This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.

     <p>The restrictions on <code>offsetof</code> may be relaxed in a future version
of the C++ standard.

architecture.  Mainly useful for the performance tuning. 
Vector operation can be implemented <code>piecewise</code>, which means that the
scalar operation is performed on every vector element;
<code>in parallel</code>, which means that the vector operation is implemented
using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and <code>as a single scalar</code>, which means that vector fits into a
scalar type.

non-trivial C++11 move assignment operator.  This is dangerous because
if the virtual base is reachable along more than one path, it is
moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end up in the
moved-from state.  If the move assignment operator is written to avoid
moving from a moved-from object, this warning can be disabled.

     <br><dt><code>-Wvla</code><dd><a name="index-Wvla-611"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dvla-612"></a>Warn if variable length array is used in the code.

not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that GCC's optimizers are unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; GCC refuses to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.

generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.

     <p>The limit applies <em>after</em> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.

     <p>This option is implied by <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp>, and can be disabled with
