<h4 class="subsection">6.43.1 Basic Asm &mdash; Assembler Instructions Without Operands</h4>

<p><a name="index-basic-_0040code_007basm_007d-3419"></a><a name="index-assembly-language-in-C_002c-basic-3420"></a>
A basic <code>asm</code> statement has the following syntax:

<pre class="example">     asm <span class="roman">[</span> volatile <span class="roman">]</span> ( <var>AssemblerInstructions</var> )
</pre>
 <p>The <code>asm</code> keyword is a GNU extension. 
When writing code that can be compiled with <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> and the
various <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> options, use <code>__asm__</code> instead of
<code>asm</code> (see <a href="Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>).

<h5 class="subsubheading">Qualifiers</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><code>volatile</code><dd>The optional <code>volatile</code> qualifier has no effect. 
All basic <code>asm</code> blocks are implicitly volatile. 
</dl>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Parameters</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><var>AssemblerInstructions</var><dd>This is a literal string that specifies the assembler code. The string can
contain any instructions recognized by the assembler, including directives. 
GCC does not parse the assembler instructions themselves and
does not know what they mean or even whether they are valid assembler input.

     <p>You may place multiple assembler instructions together in a single <code>asm</code>
string, separated by the characters normally used in assembly code for the
system. A combination that works in most places is a newline to break the
line, plus a tab character (written as `<samp><span class="samp">\n\t</span></samp>'). 
Some assemblers allow semicolons as a line separator. However,
note that some assembler dialects use semicolons to start a comment. 
</dl>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Remarks</h5>

<p>Using extended <code>asm</code> typically produces smaller, safer, and more
efficient code, and in most cases it is a better solution than basic
<code>asm</code>.  However, there are two situations where only basic <code>asm</code>
can be used:

     <ul>
<li>Extended <code>asm</code> statements have to be inside a C
function, so to write inline assembly language at file scope (&ldquo;top-level&rdquo;),
outside of C functions, you must use basic <code>asm</code>. 
You can use this technique to emit assembler directives,
define assembly language macros that can be invoked elsewhere in the file,
or write entire functions in assembly language.

     <li>Functions declared
with the <code>naked</code> attribute also require basic <code>asm</code>
(see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>). 
</ul>

 <p>Safely accessing C data and calling functions from basic <code>asm</code> is more
complex than it may appear. To access C data, it is better to use extended
<code>asm</code>.

 <p>Do not expect a sequence of <code>asm</code> statements to remain perfectly
consecutive after compilation. If certain instructions need to remain
consecutive in the output, put them in a single multi-instruction <code>asm</code>
statement. Note that GCC's optimizers can move <code>asm</code> statements
relative to other code, including across jumps.

 <p><code>asm</code> statements may not perform jumps into other <code>asm</code> statements. 
GCC does not know about these jumps, and therefore cannot take
account of them when deciding how to optimize. Jumps from <code>asm</code> to C
labels are only supported in extended <code>asm</code>.

 <p>Under certain circumstances, GCC may duplicate (or remove duplicates of) your
assembly code when optimizing. This can lead to unexpected duplicate
symbol errors during compilation if your assembly code defines symbols or
labels.

 <p>Since GCC does not parse the <var>AssemblerInstructions</var>, it has no
visibility of any symbols it references. This may result in GCC discarding
those symbols as unreferenced.

 <p>The compiler copies the assembler instructions in a basic <code>asm</code>
verbatim to the assembly language output file, without
processing dialects or any of the `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>' operators that are available with
extended <code>asm</code>. This results in minor differences between basic
<code>asm</code> strings and extended <code>asm</code> templates. For example, to refer to
registers you might use `<samp><span class="samp">%eax</span></samp>' in basic <code>asm</code> and
`<samp><span class="samp">%%eax</span></samp>' in extended <code>asm</code>.

 <p>On targets such as x86 that support multiple assembler dialects,
all basic <code>asm</code> blocks use the assembler dialect specified by the
<samp><span class="option">-masm</span></samp> command-line option (see <a href="x86-Options.html#x86-Options">x86 Options</a>). 
Basic <code>asm</code> provides no
mechanism to provide different assembler strings for different dialects.

 <p>Here is an example of basic <code>asm</code> for i386:

<pre class="example">     /* Note that this code will not compile with -masm=intel */
     #define DebugBreak() asm("int $3")
</pre>
 </body></html>
